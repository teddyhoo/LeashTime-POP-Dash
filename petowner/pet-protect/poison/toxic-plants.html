<h1>Poisonous Plants for Pets</h1>

<p>There are numerous plants that can potentially harmful to your pet if they come in contact or chew on them. For the most part, you do not need to be overly concerned that hazards abound with every plant, flower or blade of grass. Most adult dogs will leave poison plants alone, however, puppies are particularly susceptible to plant poisoning. Much like human infants who have ever increasing level of mobility, puppies will experiment in their environment. Cats are discerning grazers, however, some house plants pose a significant temptation and grave danger to cats. </p>

<p>There are other indirect factors that could lead to poisoning:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Trimming hedges and failing to pick up the loose trimmings to act as a mulch may be a tempting target for your pet to chew on; they may not actually chew on it, but bury their bone and later chew the bone that has been tainted</li>
	<li>The plant anabaena may pose a poison hazard as your pet may attempt to lick the algae off their coats in an act of self-grooming</li>
</ul>

<p>Some tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Identify all the plants in your garden</li>
	<li>Save identification sticks for any plants that you purchase</li>
	<li>Secure seeds and bulbs from your pet</li>
</ul>

<p>Steps to take when you know your pet has ingested poisonous plant</p>

<ul>
	<li>Remove any remaining plant matter from their mouth</li>
	<li>Rinse the mouth with water </li>
	<li>Examine mouth for any blistering, swelling or redness</li>
	<li>Identify and secure the plant that your pet ingested</li>
</ul>

<p>The information provided here is designed to help you identify the most serious and immediate hazards with regard to poisonous plants. Recognizing symptoms and severity of the intoxication and accurately identifying the source may save you from having to make an unnecessary (and costly) trip to the emergency vet or it may just save your pet’s life. </p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Lilium genus is made up of nearly 100 species of flowers. They are usually an upright plant, with one leafy stem per bulb, on which grows smooth leathery green leaves. The flowers are shaped like trumpets, cups or bells in a wide range of colors (except blue). </p>

<h3>Commonly seen in</h3>

<p>Mountains, sandy beaches, swampy bogs, wetlands, grassland, gardens and commercial landscapes</p>

<h3>Toxicity</h3>

<p>Toxicity is moderately high, but mostly for cats. All parts of the plant, particularly leaves</p>

<p>lilies contain oxalate crystals that cause minor signs, such as tissue irritation to the mouth, tongue, pharynx, and esophagus – this results in minor drooling. The more dangerous, potentially fatal lilies are true lilies, and these include lilies – all of which are highly toxic to cats! Even small ingestions (such as 2-3 petals or leaves) can result in severe kidney failure.</p>

<p>Generally, a cat’s first reaction to this plant includes vomiting, lethargy and lack of appetite, but kidney failure and even death can quickly follow if a cat is untreated. The peace lily (also known as Mauna Loa) is toxic to both dogs and cats. Ingestion of the peace lily or calla lily can cause irritation of the tongue and lips, increased salivation, difficulty swallowing and&nbsp;vomiting.</p>
