<h3>Pharma</h3>

<p>Contains methylxanthines (caffeine and alkaloid theobromine)</p>

<h3>Signs</h3>

<p>Hyperexcitability, vomiting, frequent urination, diarrhea rapid breathing, weakness, seizures, coma; death, which is rare, occurs by cardiac arrest</p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<p>If eaten within past 6 hrs, induce vomiting (if pet has not already vomited). Record the type and amount of chocolate ingested. </p>

<figure><img src="../assets/img/purple-grapes.jpg"/><img src="../assets/img/green-grapes.jpeg"/></figure>

<h3>Pharma</h3>

<p>It is not known how the toxic component is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, or eliminated. </p>

<h3>Signs</h3>

<p>Typically, vomiting will begin within 12 hours of ingestion. Grapes and raisins may be seen in vomit and fecal matter. Signs may be present for several days, with kidney damage leading to oliguria and finally anuria. Lack of appetite, diarrhea, become quiet with signs of abdominal pain; eventually blood calcium levels go up and kidney failure follows</p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<p>Induce vomiting; go to vet; they may need to administer fluid therapy to wash out toxins</p>

<h2>Onions, Garlic</h2>

<figure><img src="../assets/img/onion-currant.jpeg"/></figure>

<h3>Pharma</h3>

<p>Sulfur compounds that can lead to hemolytic anemia. Cats are more sensitive as their blood is more sensitive to oxidative damage. </p>

<h3>Signs</h3>

<p>Does not cause acute toxicity signs but will show up in blood work. </p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<p>Induce vomiting, administer activated charcoal. </p>

<h2>Mushrooms</h2>

<figure><img src="../assets/img/mushrooms-brown.jpg"/></figure>

<p>Mushroom poisoning is common in dogs and infrequent in cats. Few analytical labs can confirm mushroom toxicosis. It is likely that mushroom-induced poisoning is attributed to other sources of poisoning. It is critical to let the vet know if the mushrooms were obtained for medicinal or dietary purposes or were ingested in the wild. Note the size and color of the mushroom, ideally, obtain a sample of the mushroom and place into a plastic bag; additionally, note the trees in the environment as some mushroom species may be associated with particular trees. </p>

<h3>Pharma</h3>

<p>There are multiple categories of mushrooms that may be toxic:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mushrooms affecting gastrointestinal system</li>
	<li>Muscarine containing mushrooms, which cause classic cholinergic signs (SLUDD)</li>
	<li>Hallucinogenic mushrooms (isoxazole and psylocybin)</li>
	<li>Hepatoxic (amanita and gyromitin containing)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signs</h3>

<p>The most common signs of mushroom toxicity are gastrointestinal upset, including vomiting and diarrhea (possibly bloody), salivation, abdominal discomfort, and lethargy. Onset signs manifest within 15 minutes to a few hours. The symptoms persist for a few hours to several days. </p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<p>Examine the vomit output for evidence of mushrooms, as fragments might be sufficient to determine the type of mushroom ingested.</p>

<p>Induce vomiting to treat. </p>

<h2>Coffee, whole beans and grounds / Caffeine (includes teas)</h2>

<figure><img src="../assets/img/coffee-bean.jpg"/></figure>

<p>There are several possible </p>

<h3>Pharma</h3>

<p>Theobromine (the toxic element of chocolate) is a related chemical to caffeine. A small amount of caffeine ingested will generally not be harmful to your pet, however, medium to large amounts of ingested caffeine may cause death in small dogs and cats. </p>

<h3>Signs</h3>

<p>Hyperactivity, restlessness, elevated heart rate, tremors, hyperthermia, seizures, collapse</p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<h2>Macadamia Nuts</h2>

<h3>Pharma</h3>

<p>The toxic mechanism is unknown but has a </p>

<h3>Signs</h3>

<p>Mild to severe weakness in hind legs, vomiting, tremors, lethargy, increased body temperature. </p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<p>Most dogs will recover with time but treating with activated charcoal speeds recovery</p>

<h2>Alcohol</h2>

<p>This includes items that contain alcohol (e.g. eggnog, white Russian) as well as rubbing alcohol (ethanol). A pet can experience alcohol toxicosis when ingesting raw yeast dough.</p>

<h3>Pharma</h3>

<p>Ethanol is fully and quickly absorbed from all parts of the gastrointestinal tract, usually within 30 to 60 minutes. Any dose level of alcohol is potentially toxic to your pet. </p>

<h3>Signs</h3>

<p>Lethargy, vomiting, hypothermia</p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<p>If the consumption has occurred within the last 25 minutes, induce vomiting. Then, administer activated charcoal. </p>

<h2>Bread dough (raw)</h2>

<figure><img src="../assets/img/raw-bread.jpg"/></figure>

<p>A common scenario involves dogs ingesting yeast bread or roll dough left on the countertop to rise. </p>

<h3>Pharma</h3>

<p>There are two potential problems when ingesting raw yeast dough: intoxication and foreign body obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. </p>

<h3>Signs</h3>

<p>As the bread rises in the dogâ€™s digestive tract, it can create an obstruction. </p>
