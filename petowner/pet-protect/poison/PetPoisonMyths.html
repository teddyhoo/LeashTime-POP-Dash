<h2>PET POISON MYTHS</h2>

<h3>Eating small “Fresh-Packet” silica packs is harmless to cats and dogs</h3>

<p><em>FALSE</em>: Many contain silicates (Na2SiO3) activate carbon (charcoal), iron compounds (FeN3O9) or other desiccants. Iron containing packets and color indicator packets can be toxic.</p>

<h3>Ingesting Swiffer WetJets is potentially fatal, as they cause liver failure</h3>

<p><em>FALSE</em>: The product consists mostly of water (80% - 90%), propylene glycol (1%-4%), isopropyl alcohol (1%-4%) and preservatives (0.1%). Propylene alcohol is less toxic than ethylene alcohol (found in antifreeze). The concentration of propylene glycol should not be dangerous. </p>

<h3>Macadamia nuts cause muscle weakness in dogs</h3>

<p><em>TRUE</em>: Weakness, depression, vomiting usually occur within 6 hours. Symptoms improve over the course of 24 hours, especially if there are no pre-existing conditions. </p>

<h3>Grapes and raisins may cause liver failure</h3>

<p><em>TRUE</em>: Vomiting, excessive thirst, and lethargy may occur within 6 hours. This is followed by anorexia, inability to urinate, tremors and diarrhea. The quantity can be small to inflict a great deal of damage. If the pet has ingested a large quantity, induce vomiting as quickly as possible and administer activated charcoal. Additionally, aggressive fluid therapy may be necessary. Cats do not appear to be susceptible to toxicosis by grapes and raisins. Many dogs may not be susceptible. </p>

<h3>Centipedes can be harmful to your pet</h3>

<p><em>TRUE</em>: All centipedes with 21 or 23 pairs of legs are venomous and can inflict harm through their bites. No fatalities have been reported but a sting can cause vomiting, anxiety, irregular heartbeat and mild digestive issues.</p>

<h3>Eating caterpillars and butterflies can be harmful</h3>

<p><em>TRUE</em>: Several types of hair, setae or bristles cover bodies of butterflies, moths and their caterpillars. The hairs are irritants and possibly associated with venomous glands. At least 200 varieties of these insects are known to be poisonous. The injury may manifest as ophthalmic, respiratory or digestive injury.</p>

<h3>Ingestion of lipstick results in lead poisoning</h3>

<p><em>FALSE</em>: Lipstick and other cosmetics are regulated and do not use lead as an ingredient. However, many paints used in arts and crafts may contain heavy metals (lead, barium, cadmium, mercury), especially red, yellow, orange, green, violet, vermillion, white and black paints. </p>

<h3>DEET mosquito repellant is safe for use on dogs and cats</h3>

<p><em>FALSE</em>: All DEET products are potentially toxic to cats and dogs. Hypersalivation, vomiting, anxiety, tremors, ataxis, seizures may occur within 6 hours. Pets need to be decontaminated as soon as possible (washing and administration of activated charcoal). </p>

<h3>Ultra Clorox is potentially dangerous</h3>

<p><em>FALSE</em>: Both ultra and regular Clorox bleach formulations contain 5.25% aqueous sodium hypochlorite but not sodium hydroxide (lye). It is still corrosive and should be kept away from pets. </p>

<h3>Febreze odor elimination products are dangerous</h3>

<p><em>FALSE</em>: Zinc chloride was present in pre-1998 formulations but was removed and the product is sold as a pump spray rather than aerosol. Febreze contains water, alcohol, corn-derived odor eliminator, and fragrance. Toxicity is not a danger even with excessive exposure. </p>

<h3>Ingestion of Greenies treats poses risks</h3>

<p><em>TRUE</em>: Greenies are, for the most part, safe and enjoyable and nutritious treat for pets. They contain wheat gluten, glycerin, cellulose, and other additives. The treats are designed to be chewed before ingestion (to help with bad breath, tartar buildup and gingivitis). However, if not properly chewed, the treat fragment may cause an intestinal obstruction. </p>

<h3>Ingestion of Easter lilies (Lillium longiflorum) is highly poisonous to cats</h3>

<p><em>TRUE</em>: Vomiting, hyper salivation, depression and anorexia occur within 1 to 2 hours after ingestion. This is followed by liver failure within 2 to 4 days. All parts of the plant are poisonous and all species of Lillium are toxic. Dogs appear to only suffer gastrointestinal symptoms. </p>
