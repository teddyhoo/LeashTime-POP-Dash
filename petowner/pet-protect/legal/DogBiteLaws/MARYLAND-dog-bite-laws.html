		            <td>Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this Section, when the Administrator or, if the Administrator is not a veterinarian, the Deputy Administrator receives information that any person has been bitten by an animal, the Administrator or, if the Administrator is not a veterinarian, the Deputy Administrator, or his or her authorized representative, shall have such dog or other animal confined under the observation of a licensed veterinarian. The confinement shall be for a period of not less than 10 days from the date the bite occurred and shall continue until the animal has been examined and released from confinement by a licensed veterinarian. The Administrator or, if the Administrator is not a veterinarian, the Deputy Administrator may permit such confinement to be reduced to a period of less than 10 days.

		            <p>(a-5) The owner, or if the owner is unavailable, an agent or caretaker of an animal documented to have bitten a person shall present the animal to a licensed veterinarian within 24 hours. A veterinarian presented with an animal documented to have bitten a person shall make a record of the clinical condition of the animal immediately. At the end of the confinement period, the animal shall be examined by a licensed veterinarian, inoculated against rabies, if eligible, and microchipped, if the dog or cat has not been already, at the expense of the owner. The veterinarian shall submit a written report listing the owner's name, address, dates of confinement, dates of examination, species, breed, description, age, sex, and microchip number of the animal to the Administrator advising him or her of the clinical condition and the final disposition of the animal on appropriate forms approved by the Department. The Administrator shall notify the person who has been bitten, and in the case of confirmed rabies in the animal, the attending physician or responsible health agency advising of the clinical condition of the animal.

		            <p> (a-10) When the Administrator or, if the Administrator is not a veterinarian, the Deputy Administrator or his or her authorized representative receives information that a person has been bitten by an animal and evidence is presented that the animal at the time the bite occurred was inoculated against rabies within the time prescribed by law, the animal may be confined in a house, or in a manner which will prohibit the animal from biting a person, if the Administrator, Deputy Administrator, or his or her authorized representative determines the confinement satisfactory. The confinement shall be for a period of not less than 10 days from the date the bite occurred and shall continue until the animal has been examined and released from confinement by a licensed veterinarian. The Administrator or, if the Administrator is not a veterinarian, the Deputy Administrator may instruct the owner, agent, or caretaker to have the animal examined by a licensed veterinarian immediately. The Administrator or, if the Administrator is not a veterinarian, the Deputy Administrator may permit the confinement to be reduced to a period of less than 10 days. At the end of the confinement period, the animal shall be examined by a licensed veterinarian and microchipped, if the dog or cat is not already, at the expense of the owner. The veterinarian shall submit a written report listing the owner's name, address, dates of examination, species, breed, description, age, sex, and microchip number of the animal to the Administrator advising him or her of the clinical condition and the final disposition of the animal on appropriate forms approved by the Department. The Administrator shall notify the person who has been bitten and, in case of confirmed rabies in the animal, the attending physician or responsible health agency advising of the clinical condition of the animal.</td>

		            <td>(510 ILCS 5/15) (from Ch. 8, par. 365) 
    Sec. 15. (a) In order to have a dog deemed "vicious", the Administrator, Deputy Administrator, or law enforcement officer must give notice of the infraction that is the basis of the investigation to the owner, conduct a thorough investigation, interview any witnesses, including the owner, gather any existing medical records, veterinary medical records or behavioral evidence, and make a detailed report recommending a finding that the dog is a vicious dog and give the report to the State's Attorney's Office and the owner. The Administrator, State's Attorney, Director or any citizen of the county in which the dog exists may file a complaint in the circuit court in the name of the People of the State of Illinois to deem a dog to be a vicious dog. Testimony of a certified applied behaviorist, a board certified veterinary behaviorist, or another recognized expert may be relevant to the court's determination of whether the dog's behavior was justified. The petitioner must prove the dog is a vicious dog by clear and convincing evidence. The Administrator shall determine where the animal shall be confined during the pendency of the case. 
    <P>A dog may not be declared vicious if the court determines the conduct of the dog was justified because: 
    <ol>
    <li>the threat, injury, or death was sustained by aperson who at the time was committing a crime or offense upon the owner or custodian of the dog, or was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises or property owned or occupied by the owner of the animal;
	<li>the injured, threatened, or killed person wasabusing, assaulting, or physically threatening the dog or its offspring, or has in the past abused, assaulted, or physically threatened the dog or its offspring; or      
	<li>the dog was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting itself, its owner, custodian, or member of its household, kennel, or offspring.
