This is extremely dog owner friendly, because the plaintiff cannot even conribute 1% to the dog bite incident. This means the plaintiff nullifies all possible damage recovery if they are found to have contributed to the dog bite incident, no matter how egregiously negligent the dog owner had been. </td>
