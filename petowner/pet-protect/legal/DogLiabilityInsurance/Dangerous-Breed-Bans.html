			            <td class="organisationnumber">PThis statutory framework was temporarily amended on an emergency basis in 1996 by the Pit Bull Act, pursuant to which McNeely was convicted.9 In relevant part, the Act added the pit bull breed—as defined by either the American Kennel Club or the United Kennel Club—to the definition of a dangerous dog.10 See sec. 2(a), 43 D.C.Reg. at 2156. It further excepted all pit bulls from the provisions of D.C.Code §§ 6–1021.2 and 6–1021.3, thus removing the need for an administrative hearing in order to classify any particular pit bull as a dangerous dog. See sec. 2(b), 43 D.C.Reg. at 2156. A new provision was added to allow the Mayor to impound and humanely destroy any pit bull found within the District which had not been licensed and specially registered under D.C.Code § 6–1021.4, unless the owner provided sufficient evidence to prove in an administrative hearing either that the dog was in fact not a pit bull, or that the pit bull would be permanently removed from the District of Columbia. See sec. 2(c), 43 D.C.Reg. at 2157. Most pivotal to this case is the Act’s amendment of the penalty provisions of D.C.Code § 6–1021.6. While excepting all owners of pit bulls from civil fines arising from technical violations of the special registration provisions,11 see sec. 2(f)(1), 43 D.C.Reg. at 2158, the Pit Bull Act substantially augmented the penalty imposed upon an owner when a pit bull causes injury to another person or domestic animal: [a] pit bull or a Rottweiler that causes injury to or kills a human being or a domestic animal without provocation shall be humanly [sic] destroyed and the owner of such dog shall be fined up to $20,000 and may be sentenced to not more than 2 years of imprisonment.
