Proposed changes to LeashTime API:


(1) mmd-visits.php

One of the functions of the manager sitter app is to display interim state of the visit reports.
Add the following fields to visit dictionary:

- visitReportSent				<DATE>
- mapSnapURL 					<URL>
- photoURL							<URL>
- visitReportReceived		<DATE>
- moodButtons					<ARRAY>
- visitNote							<STRING>

Another addition to this endpoint is  sending a list of Unassigned Visits in the array.

(2) mmd-sitters.php

Add sitter email and phone number(s) fields.

See #1 regarding Unassigned visits.

(3) visit-report-list-ajax.php 

Currently, this accepts a single clientid parameter. 
The likely use case for this api endpoint (for a manager) is to gather an entire
day of visit reports for clients serviced that day. 

(4) visit-report-data.php

In the response, please indicate the following:

- What components are configured to be sent for the template (E.g. mood buttons,
visit note, arrive, complete time, photo, mapsnap)?
- Indicate whether the specific client has the communication option enabled and 
accepts visit reports via email or text message.

(5) NEW API ENDPOINT: send-visit-report-to-pet-owner.php

parameters: clientID
